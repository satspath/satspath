//! BIP-353 adapter for the resolver chain.
//!
//! A BIP-353 name (`₿alice@example.com`) resolves to a DNSSEC-signed
//! `bitcoin:` URI. That is a *payment instruction* authenticated by DNSSEC —
//! it is **not** a SatsPath profile signed by the recipient's identity key.
//!
//! An earlier version of this resolver parsed the TXT record, generated a
//! fresh random keypair, and self-signed a synthetic profile with it. The
//! `pay` command then verified that self-signature and printed
//! "Signature valid.", presenting an unauthenticated DNS answer as a verified
//! identity. The signature attested nothing about the recipient.
//!
//! This resolver therefore:
//! * delegates resolution to [`crate::bip353::resolve_bip353_with`] under
//!   [`DnssecPolicy::Strict`], which fails closed on any record that was not
//!   DNSSEC-validated, rejects multiple `bitcoin:` records, reconstructs
//!   multi-string TXT records correctly and validates the BIP-321 URI;
//! * exposes the result as a [`Bip353Resolution`] via
//!   [`Bip353Resolver::resolve_instruction`];
//! * never fabricates a key or signature. As a [`ProfileResolver`] it refuses
//!   `₿` names with an explicit error instead of returning a "signed" profile.
