# SatsPath Protocol v1

SatsPath is a payment discovery and routing protocol for Bitcoin rails. It defines signed payment profiles, verification rules, resolver semantics, and quote responses for Lightning, on-chain, and Ark receive pointers.

SatsPath is not a wallet, not a Bitcoin node, and not a transport-specific peer-to-peer system. Pear/Holepunch is one possible transport for moving SatsPath protocol objects between machines; it is not the protocol itself.

## Scope

SatsPath v1 specifies:

- Human-readable recipient identifiers.
- Signed payment profiles.
- Public receive pointers for Lightning, on-chain Bitcoin, and Ark.
- Resolver semantics for locating signed profiles.
- Verification rules before routing.
- Quote response states for wallet and UI clients.
- Transport-neutral behavior, including how optional P2P transports carry protocol objects.

SatsPath v1 does not specify:

- Custody of funds.
- Wallet seed or spending-key storage.
- Mainnet transaction signing.
- Mainnet transaction broadcast.
- Lightning node operation.
- Ark server operation.

Payment execution belongs to the underlying wallet or rail. SatsPath discovers and validates where a payment can be sent, then returns public payment instructions.

## Terminology

`Identifier`
: A human-readable name for a receiver, normally `user@domain`.

`PaymentProfile`
: Public profile data containing a receiver alias, protocol identity public key, supported payment methods, timestamps, and optional method-verification records.

`SignedPaymentProfile`
: A `PaymentProfile` plus a secp256k1 Schnorr signature made by the profile identity key.

`PaymentMethod`
: One public receive pointer. v1 methods are `Lightning`, `Onchain`, and `Ark`.

`Resolver`
: A component that maps an identifier to a `SignedPaymentProfile`.

`QuoteResponse`
: The protocol-level response returned after resolution, signature verification, expiry checks, route selection, and payment-payload construction.

`Transport`
: A way to carry SatsPath objects. Examples include local files, HTTPS, DNS/BIP-353, Nostr, and Pear/Holepunch.

## Identifiers

The canonical identifier format is:

```txt
<local-part>@<domain>
```

Resolvers MUST treat identifiers as case-insensitive for lookup normalization unless the transport defines stricter semantics. Implementations SHOULD trim leading and trailing whitespace before lookup.

An identifier by itself is not an ownership proof. A profile signature proves
control of the SatsPath protocol identity key embedded in the profile. DNSSEC,
HTTPS well-known, Nostr/NIP-05, or a platform verifier may add evidence that the
identifier was published or approved by the relevant domain/account, but plain
email syntax alone MUST be treated as `identifier-only`.

Examples:

```txt
alice@example.com
rodrigo@satspath.dev
shop@merchant.example
```

BIP-353 names MAY be represented with a leading Bitcoin sign:

```txt
₿alice@example.com
```

The leading sign selects DNS payment-instruction resolution behavior; it does not change the receiver identity once normalized.

## Signed Payment Profiles

A `PaymentProfile` is public and contains no wallet secrets.

```json
{
  "alias": "alice@example.com",
  "identity_pubkey": "02...",
  "methods": [
    {
      "type": "Lightning",
      "label": "Lightning Address",
      "lightning_address": "alice@example.com",
      "lnurl": null,
      "bolt12": null,
      "receiver_pubkey": null
    }
  ],
  "updated_at": 1782810000,
  "expires_at": null
}
```

A `SignedPaymentProfile` wraps the profile with a signature:

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "alias": "alice@example.com",
    "identity_pubkey": "02...",
    "methods": []
  },
  "signature": "<128 lowercase hex characters>"
}
```

### Signing Rule

The signature is computed over a domain-separated SHA-256 digest of the canonical JSON serialization of `profile`.

```txt
message = SHA256(UTF8("SatsPathProfileV1") || canonical_json_utf8(profile))
signature = secp256k1_schnorr_sign(identity_secret_key, message)
```

Implementations MUST keep serialization stable for the profile shape they sign. Implementations MUST NOT sign or transmit wallet seeds, xprv/tprv material, mnemonics, Lightning macaroons, Ark claim keys, refund keys, or other private spending material.

### Verification Rule

Before using any profile for routing, an implementation MUST:

1. Parse `identity_pubkey` from hex as exactly a 33-byte compressed secp256k1 public key (`02`/`03` prefix).
2. Serialize with RFC 8259 JSON semantics, recursively lexicographically sorted object keys, UTF-8, and no insignificant whitespace.
3. Recompute `SHA256(UTF8("SatsPathProfileV1") || canonical_json_utf8(profile))`.
4. Decode `signature` as exactly 64 bytes of hex and verify secp256k1 Schnorr against the x-only projection of the compressed key. DER ECDSA MUST be rejected.
5. Reject the profile if `expires_at` is present and in the past.
6. Reject private material if any private-key-like content is detected in public fields.

Profile schema/signature version 1 is selected by `SatsPathProfileV1`; an incompatible future profile requires a new domain.

### Key Rotation V1

The old key authorizes and the new key separately accepts these newline-delimited UTF-8 statements (no trailing newline):

```text
SatsPathKeyRotationAuthorizationV1
identifier_hash
old_pubkey
new_pubkey
previous_event_hash
sequence
rotated_at
```

```text
SatsPathKeyRotationAcceptanceV1
identifier_hash
old_pubkey
new_pubkey
previous_event_hash
sequence
rotated_at
```

Each complete statement is SHA-256 hashed and signed as a 64-byte secp256k1 Schnorr signature. `identifier_hash` is `SHA256(UTF8(canonical_identifier))`.

If signature verification fails, the protocol result MUST be `invalid_signature`.

If the profile is expired or unusable, the protocol result MUST be `no_route`.

## Payment Methods

### Lightning

Lightning methods carry at least one public Lightning receive pointer:

```json
{
  "type": "Lightning",
  "label": "Lightning Address",
  "lightning_address": "alice@example.com",
  "lnurl": null,
  "bolt12": null,
  "receiver_pubkey": null
}
```

At least one of `lightning_address`, `lnurl`, or `bolt12` MUST be present for the method to be routable.

If a quote implementation can safely fetch a concrete BOLT11 invoice from an LNURL-pay endpoint, it MAY return that invoice as the payment payload. Otherwise it MUST return a public Lightning pointer.

### On-chain

On-chain methods carry a public Bitcoin address:

```json
{
  "type": "Onchain",
  "label": "Bitcoin (mainnet)",
  "network": "Mainnet",
  "address": "bc1q...",
  "pubkey_hint": null,
  "descriptor_hint": null
}
```

Implementations MUST validate that the address matches the expected network for the operating mode. Implementations SHOULD prefer fresh addresses and multiple on-chain methods for privacy, but v1 does not mandate address rotation.

### Ark

Ark methods carry a public Ark server and receiver public key:

```json
{
  "type": "Ark",
  "label": "Ark",
  "server": "https://ark.example.com",
  "pubkey": "02...",
  "vtxo_pointer": null,
  "proof": null,
  "expires_at": null
}
```

Ark receive pointers are public routing instructions. SatsPath v1 does not execute Ark transfers on mainnet.

## Resolver Semantics

A resolver maps an identifier to a `SignedPaymentProfile`.

Resolver results are:

- `found`: a signed profile was found and returned.
- `not_found`: no signed profile exists for this identifier in that resolver.
- `unavailable`: resolver transport failed or timed out.
- `invalid`: resolver returned malformed or unsafe data.

A resolver chain MUST continue past `not_found` and transient `unavailable` results. A resolver chain MUST stop on a successfully verified profile. A resolver chain MAY stop on `invalid` when the invalid data is authoritative for that identifier.

Resolver behavior is specified in [resolvers.md](./resolvers.md).

## Quote Response Contract

SatsPath Mainnet Preview is a public-data-only protocol mode that operates strictly in the first three phases of a payment lifecycle:

1. **Resolve**: Fetch the signed profile for the identifier.
2. **Route**: Check signatures, expiry, ownership, and select the best rail.
3. **Invoice Presentation**: Fetch LNURL/BOLT11 data, format BIP-21 or Ark URIs, and display the payment pointer or QR.
4. **Execution**: **(Out of scope for Mainnet Preview)** The user scans the QR and pays using their own wallet.

The protocol quote response is serialized as a JSON object tagged by `status`.

### `ok`

Returned when a profile is found, verified, not expired, and at least one route is available.

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "recipient": {
    "alias": "alice@example.com",
    "verified": true,
    "profile_signature_verified": true,
    "identifier_verified": false,
    "identifier_verification": "identifier-only; no inbox/domain ownership proof in this response",
    "fingerprint": "a8fdac91"
  },
  "selected_method": {
    "type": "Lightning",
    "label": "Lightning Address",
    "lightning_address": "alice@example.com"
  },
  "fee_sats": 1,
  "eta": "instant",
  "reason": "Amount is below Lightning threshold and Lightning is available.",
  "qr": "alice@example.com"
}
```

The payload preview formats are:

- `lightning:<address>` for Lightning Address preview,
- `lnurl:<url>` for LNURL preview,
- a BOLT11 invoice string only when explicitly fetched by the caller,
- `bitcoin:<address>?amount=<btc>` for on-chain mainnet preview,
- `satspath:ark?...&network=mainnet` for Ark public pointer preview.

It must not:

- sign transactions,
- broadcast transactions,
- execute Lightning payments,
- execute Ark transfers,
- execute swaps,
- handle seeds, xprv/tprv, macaroons, certs, API secrets, claim keys, refund
  keys, or wallet private keys.

Mainnet execution (Phase 4 automation) is not part of v1 prototype behavior and no execution flag exists for mainnet.

## Experimental Swap Engine (Execution Phase)

Execution automation (such as submarine swaps, reverse swaps, or Ark VTXO transfers) is built into an experimental engine that is **strictly testnet-only**. This engine handles Phase 4, but is disabled by default and sandboxed away from mainnet to prevent any risk to real funds.

## Invite Flow

When the resolver cannot find a registered alias, the sender creates an invite
instead of failing silently:

```json
{
  "invite": {
    "alias_hash": "a1b2c3d4...",
    "amount_sats": 1000,
    "created_at": 1782810000,
    "claim_url": "https://satspath.local/claim?alias_hash=...&amount=...",
    "warning": "Receiver must generate their own keys locally."
  }
}
```

`qr` is the public payment payload to show, copy, or hand off to a wallet.

`recipient.verified` is a legacy compatibility field. Clients SHOULD prefer the
explicit `profile_signature_verified` and `identifier_verified` fields. It MUST
NOT be displayed as email/inbox verification unless `identifier_verified` is
also true.

### `not_registered`

Returned when no resolver can find a signed profile.

```json
{
  "status": "not_registered",
  "invite": {
    "alias_hash": "be8979...",
    "amount_sats": 250,
    "created_at": 1782810000,
    "claim_url": "https://satspath.local/claim?alias_hash=...&amount=250",
    "warning": "Receiver must generate their own keys locally."
  }
}
```

No funds should move solely because an invite exists. The receiver must publish a signed profile before a normal quote can be produced.

### `no_route`

Returned when a profile is valid but no supported payment method can be selected.

```json
{
  "status": "no_route",
  "reason": "No supported payment method is available."
}
```

### `invalid_signature`

Returned when a profile is found but signature verification fails.

```json
{
  "status": "invalid_signature",
  "recipient": {
    "alias": "alice@example.com",
    "verified": false,
    "fingerprint": null
  }
}
```

Clients MUST NOT offer payment execution for `invalid_signature`.

## Routing Semantics

The v1 routing engine receives:

```txt
recipient identifier
amount_sats
verified SignedPaymentProfile
fee environment
```

The current reference policy is:

1. Prefer Lightning for small amounts when a Lightning method is available.
2. Consider on-chain when fee conditions make it acceptable and an on-chain method is available.
3. Consider Ark when an Ark method is available.
4. Return `no_route` when no available method passes policy.

The response MUST include a human-readable `reason` describing the selected route.

Routing policy MAY evolve without changing the quote response wire shape.

## Mandatory Transparency Composition

The standalone daemon MUST NOT route `/v1/quote`, `/v1/pay` or `/v1/preview`
from a self-contained signed profile alone. These endpoints use the same result
as `/v1/resolve` and verify, in order: canonical profile signature and expiry,
identifier history, key continuity, latest profile/event binding, inclusion in
the exact signed checkpoint, consistency with the `log_id` pin, operator-key
continuity, and payment-method ownership. Failure is terminal and MUST NOT fall
back to the legacy resolver chain.

Name-event hashing uses two distinct values:

```text
signing_payload_hash = SHA256("SatsPathNameEventPayloadV1" || canonical_json(unsigned_event))
owner_signature      = Schnorr("SatsPathNameEventSignatureV1\n" || hex(signing_payload_hash))
signed_event_hash    = SHA256("SatsPathSignedNameEventV1" || canonical_json(full_signed_event))
leaf_hash            = SHA256(0x00 || raw(signed_event_hash))
```

All quoted strings above are exact UTF-8 bytes with no NUL separator. Hex is
lowercase. `previous_event_hash` is the preceding `signed_event_hash`.
Registration uses sequence 0; every accepted mutation increments exactly once,
and profile, event and rotation sequences MUST match.

An inclusion result is valid only if proof root/size equal checkpoint root/size,
the leaf is derived from the requested signed event hash, the Merkle audit path
verifies, and the checkpoint's 64-byte secp256k1 Schnorr signature verifies.
Pins are keyed by stable `log_id`; a changed operator public key requires old-key
authorization and new-key acceptance in a versioned operator rotation.

## Payment Handoff

SatsPath v1 returns public payment payloads. It does not spend funds.

An implementation MAY expose a local API such as:

```txt
POST /v1/pay
```

This API MUST still return a protocol decision and a wallet handoff. It MUST NOT sign, broadcast, or custody funds unless a future protocol version explicitly defines an execution extension.

## Transport Neutrality

SatsPath objects can move over multiple transports:

- Local registry files.
- HTTPS well-known endpoints.
- BIP-353 DNS payment instructions.
- Nostr/NIP-05 profile announcements.
- Pear/Holepunch peer transport.
- Manual file export/import.

All transports carry the same protocol objects and MUST be verified using the same profile verification rules.

### Nostr Transport Profile

Nostr transport uses NIP-05 to bind an identifier domain to a Nostr pubkey and relay list. The SatsPath profile itself is carried in a replaceable Nostr event:

```json
{
  "kind": 30078,
  "pubkey": "<nip05 nostr pubkey hex>",
  "tags": [["d", "satspath-profile:alice@example.com"]],
  "content": "{\"profile\":{...},\"signature\":\"<64-byte-schnorr-hex>\"}"
}
```

Resolution MUST verify:

1. The NIP-05 document maps the local identifier part to the event author pubkey.
2. The event kind is `30078`.
3. The event author is the NIP-05 pubkey.
4. The `d` tag is `satspath-profile:<canonical identifier>`.
5. The event content parses as `SignedPaymentProfile`.
6. The SatsPath profile signature and expiry checks pass.

Nostr event signatures do not replace SatsPath profile signatures. Nostr is a discovery transport; SatsPath profile verification remains mandatory.

Pear/Holepunch is specified as an optional wire transport in [wire_p2p.md](./wire_p2p.md).

## Security Requirements

Implementations MUST:

- Verify signed profiles before routing.
- Reject malformed public keys and signatures.
- Reject expired profiles.
- Reject private material in public fields.
- Treat resolver output as untrusted until verified.
- Fail closed for DNSSEC-required flows unless explicitly placed into an insecure development mode.
- Never convert an invite into a payable route without re-resolving a signed profile.

Implementations SHOULD:

- Display whether a recipient was verified.
- Display the selected rail and routing reason.
- Separate route decision from payment execution.
- Keep resolver failures observable for debugging.

## Reference Implementation Mapping

The current Rust implementation follows this spec through:

- `crates/satspath-core/src/profile.rs`: `PaymentProfile`, `PaymentMethod`, and `SignedPaymentProfile`.
- `crates/satspath-core/src/crypto.rs`: profile signing and verification.
- `crates/satspath-core/src/resolver.rs`: resolver trait and resolver chain semantics.
- `crates/satspath-core/src/resolvers/*`: transport-specific resolvers.
- `crates/satspath-router/src/quote_response.rs`: `QuoteResponse` contract and quote orchestration.
- `crates/satspath-router/src/router.rs`: route selection policy.
- `crates/satspathd/src/main.rs`: local daemon API exposing status, profile, peers, DNS resolution, quote, and pay handoff.
