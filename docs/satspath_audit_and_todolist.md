## 3. Production Roadmap (v0.2 Tasks)

### Phase 1: Reference Wallet Integration (Arkade Money PWA)
- [ ] Connect `@satspath/wasm` to Arkade wallet onboarding modal.
- [ ] Auto-populate public receiving addresses (Lightning, Ark pubkey, On-chain) upon identity initialization.
- [ ] Intercept send input for `@` human-readable identifiers and call `quote()`.

### Phase 2: Post-Quantum & Advanced Cryptography
- [ ] **Hybrid Signature Scheme**: Combine classical `secp256k1` Schnorr with **ML-DSA (Dilithium)**.
- [ ] **Hybrid P2P Key Encapsulation**: Combine `X25519` with **ML-KEM (Kyber)** for peer-to-peer secrets.
- [ ] **Silent Payments (BIP-352)**: Full ephemeral address derivation in client SDK.

### Phase 3: Distributed Witness Consensus
- [ ] Multi-node $K$-of-$N$ cosigning protocol in `satspath-witness`.
- [ ] Split-view automated gossip and alert propagation.
